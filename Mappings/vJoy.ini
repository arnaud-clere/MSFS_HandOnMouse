; This file contains mappings between mouse inputs and vJoy axis adapted to aircrafts that do not support SimVars such as Aerosoft CRJ

; BEWARE that:
; - MSFS controls mapped to VJoyAxis should not be changed from inside MSFS virtual cockpit as it will jump back to MSFS_HandOnMouse stored position next time the mouse is used
; - it will not work if vJoy virtual joystick driver
; - it will not work as designed if MSFS controls are not correctly mapped to vJoy or other devices are already mapped to these MSFS controls

; Using these mappings require to:
; 1. Download vJoy driver: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/files/Beta%202.x/2.1.9.1-160719/vJoySetup.exe/download
; 2. Install it by running: vJoySetup.exe
; 3. Map vJoy axis displayed by HandOnMouse to desired MSFS functions

; VJoyAxis= | MSFS vJoy Axis Name | MSFS control to map to
; ----------+---------------------+-----------------------
;  SLIDERX  |  Slider X           | Throttle Axis
;  SLIDERY  |  Slider Y           | Spoiler Axis
;  LX       |  L-Axis X           | Left  Brakes Axis
;  RX       |  R-Axis X           | Right Brakes Axis

; TODO To support reverse throttle on Throttle Axis 1 & 2:
; VJoyNegativeButton= | MSFS vJoy Button Name | MSFS control to map to
; --------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------
; 1                   | 1                     | HOLD THROTTLE REVERSE THRUST
