MSFS Utility to keep your HandOnMouse for easier/better flying

MSFS virtual cockpits are wonderfully immersive but can become challenging when flying requires to actuate critical knobs and levers quickly.
* Takeoffs may require to quickly retract gear and/or flaps before critical speeds are reached.
* Landings may require to adjust flaps (or even gliders' spoilers) and/or trim without delay.
Even with dedicated hardware such as quadrants, having to leave your mouse may badly delay other actions such as preparing the aircraft (lights, accessories), completing checklists, answering ATC, etc.

I guess using VR mode makes all of these even more challenging.

The solution I use for quite some time now is a small utility that allows mapping critical actions to mouse moves combined with dedicated buttons pressed.
Since many mouse are equipped with forward/backward buttons and these are not mapped by default to anything, the utility comes with preconfigured mappings suited to various aircraft types using these buttons:
* jets configuration map 

Otherwise, you can edit a documented Custom.ini mappings file to use other buttons, control other Simulation Variables, etc.

Enjoy, and let me know what you think!
